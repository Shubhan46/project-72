The campus was built east of Bhagalpur Town in the vicinity of Ranitalab and the Bhagalpur Engineering College. In 2012, a new building for the +1 and +2 students was built with a large auditorium.In the late 1980s girls were allowed in and a co-educational school was born. In 1992 the Plus Two wing was built, initially for a Science Wing and was co-educational. Fr. Jose Thottunkal TOR and Fr. Thomas Chittokulam TOR, then Principal and Vice Principal were in charge.</p>
